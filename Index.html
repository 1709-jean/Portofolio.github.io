<p style="font-family: Rockwell">The world has entered the era of 4.O and soon we will be heading to 5.O. Technology is developing very rapidly. All the tools we used to use manually now have tools that are even faster to complete than those of us who did. So that it has a huge influence on people who really need work. Given these conditions, it requires most people to study the systems that work on these technologies. Ultimately, we are system controllers. If there is damage, then our energy is needed for factories or restaurants that use engine power.  <br>So the more developments, therefore it becomes a lesson for us to continue to look for other ways so that our energy is still needed, even with the existence of this technology. In essence, in this era we can fulfill our lives by looking for opportunities what is needed with technology that continues to develop.</p>

<p style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">This growing technology has also made several majors that were previously considered to be underestimated into majors that are very difficult to find because of the large number of enthusiasts who are eager to enter the department. The majors are Informatics Engineering, Information Management, Information Systems, Computer Science, and other departments related to technology. When I took a major in technology, I argued with my father for nearly 3 years since entering high school. When I first entered high school I really wanted to take a major like geography, but I got opposition from my father. And my papa kept pushing me continuously to enter the technology department. It was difficult for me to gather the intention to match my father's wishes. However, as time went by and my father continued to include me in several IT-related events organized by the Telkom, I finally got interested. Even if you only know how to form a start-up company in its raw form, without knowing how difficult the world of matchmaking is. <br>In the end, when I entered college I took an IT-related major. And now I am an active student at Duta Wacana Christian University majoring in information system. I am very interested in activities that I have never tried since high school, such as organizing activities, volunteering on campus, and many other things that I could not experience in high school and I managed to get them while in college. Sometimes, I get news about a competition to make a system I am very interested in, but my skills and team are not sufficient. Even though there are certain failures in the competition, for me if I want to try new things, at least I have the basics that will guide me so that I can have the basic knowledge that is obtained.
<br><br>In the opportunities that exist during this college period, I always want to try it. The principle in my life is more trying than nothing and being curious about it. Trying various experiences for me is like tasting all new foods, if you feel that you are compatible, then you will remember the taste of the food. With this opportunity, on the next page I will present a description of myself as a form of my seriousness.
